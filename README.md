Project: Controlling servo via hand gesture.
Software used:  
1.VS Code:
    a. Python (packages: pip, opencv,  mediapipe, serial)
    b. Arduino IDE
    c. TinkerCAD 
Hardwares used:
1. Servo motor (SG90)
2. Arduino Nano
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires
Observations:
     Python codes must be written in variable environment. Mediapipe module does not work in versions newer than version 3.10. This does not mean that newer version must be deleted, as they can co-exist. During test, it was observed that, low light hampers the work. SO, it is better to make sure that the room has sufficient light.
